# Windows Forms Dotnet Control Collection
Check back here often this is a work in progress here you will find many extened dotnet controls for win forms in one place.

This will take some time to complete I currently have around 12 controls and more to come.

When possible I will post a link to each controls source code.

Some of these controls have been modified by me to include properties that I thought would improve the original code.

1) My cropper Control the idea was to be able to add a crop control from the toolbpox. I was sucessful in adding it to the form but not as a toolbox control. Problem wwas as I found out a control in the toolbox must not contain any parameters in my case I wanted to pass any control. Second problem was I could add the cotrol but it wasnt trasnparent. I,ll be working on that if anyone has any ideas drop me a note.
